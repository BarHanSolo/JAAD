# JAAD Dataset Annotations
This repository contains annotation data for JAAD (Joint Attention in Autonomous Driving) dataset.  

JAAD dataset aims to provide samples for pedestrian detection, pedestrian action and gesture recognition and behavioral study of traffic participants. The data consists of 346 high-resolution video clips (5-15s) with annotations showing various situations typical
for urban driving. The videos are recorded using dashboard mounted cameras...

All video sequences can be downloaded in mp4 and seq format from our project site http://data.nvision2.eecs.yorku.ca/JAAD_dataset/.
To convert the video clips to image sequences, use the script 'split_clips_to_frames.sh'.
